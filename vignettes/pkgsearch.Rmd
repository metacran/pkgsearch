The pkgsearch package searches all CRAN packages. It uses a web service,
and a careful weighting that ranks popular packages before less
frequently used ones. The package also has functions to list the new / most recently updated / archived packages, and list all versions of a package.

In this vignette, read about how `pkgsearch` supports

* [search over all CRAN packages](#search-cran-packages-with-pkgsearch), e.g. by keyword ("colour", "GLM", etc.);

* [extraction of CRAN information](#get-cran-metadata), e.g. releases and archivals.
